6040,deal,,,,,,,,,
6041,i would like the ball and the book . you can have all the hats .,,,,,,,,,
6042,great ! have a great night !,,,,,,,,,
6043,i can agree to that,,,,,,,,,
6044,i'd like the book and the hats you keep the balls ?,,,,,,,,,
6045,that was the main item in my initial offer . book and 1 hat for me you get rest ?,,,,,,,,,
6046,i think that's the best split for the both of us .,,,,,,,,,
6047,could i take the balls and get the book as well ?,,,,,,,,,
6048,"hats are meaningless for me , so you may as well take them both . so i'm taking all balls and you get the rest ?",,,,,,,,,
6049,can i have the book and one hat instead ?,,,,,,,,,
6050,i'll take 1 ball and a book you get the hats and the other ball,,,,,,,,,
6051,yes,,,,,,,,,
6052,"ill take the hat and ball , you can have the books .",,,,,,,,,

6054,so what now ?,,,,,,,,,
6055,ok you sure no deal ?,,,,,,,,,
6056,ill get 5,,,,,,,,,
6057,no deal,,,,,,,,,
6058,i'll take a hat and a book,,,,,,,,,

6060,we wait till the no deal button comes up and we click on it,,,,,,,,,
6061,without the hat i ger 4 / 10,,,,,,,,,
6062,so we are stuck,,,,,,,,,
6063,ok deal,,,,,,,,,
6064,i would like both books and the ball,,,,,,,,,
6065,deal,,,,,,,,,
6066,"i really like the books and i like the hats , too . what do you want ?",,,,,,,,,
6067,"i get both books and one hat , you get the rest ?",,,,,,,,,
6068,i really think the fair thing would be to split the 6 items so we each have 3 .,,,,,,,,,
6069,"i see two of each item , so we actually do know the quantity of items . i don't understand ?",,,,,,,,,
6070,"i have nothing of high value , are the books worth it for you ? you get both books , i get the rest ?",,,,,,,,,
6071,"i'd be losing out if i dropped the hat . i think based on your initial offer and interest in the books , the other items should be left to me .",,,,,,,,,
6072,"we know its not about the quantity of items , but the value of their points . your books hold a slightly substantial value based on your initial interest . i'm willing to give them both up for the remaining items .",,,,,,,,,
6073,"there's 6 items , but the value of the item is different to each of us as per the instructions . you wanting both books means they hold a substantial value . . . i'm willing to concede to the books , but i'd like the other 4 items since they're low value to me .",,,,,,,,,
6074,i would like 3 balls and the hat and book,,,,,,,,,
6075,"that was my opener so i expect counter offers of course , i don't really want the book and would much prefer the balls over anything else .",,,,,,,,,
6076,anyway i can get 3 balls ?,,,,,,,,,
6077,i guess we can do 2 balls for me and the book . you get 2 balls and the hat,,,,,,,,,
6078,"well , since this hit calls for us to negotiate an agreement . i'd like to find an offer that works for the both of us instead of giving you every item . you can definitely have the book , what else would you like to offer ?",,,,,,,,,
6079,"book has no value to me at all , i assume it'll give you minimal points . i'd be ok with two balls and the hat ?",,,,,,,,,
6080,"that wouldn't allow me any points . i need to settle at 3 balls , or two balls and the hat ; can we make one of them work ?",,,,,,,,,
6081,i assume that's fair . deal .,,,,,,,,,
6082,nope sorry . i need the ball . you can have the hat and 2 books if youd like,,,,,,,,,
6083,sorry i cant do that . guess we wont be reaching a deal,,,,,,,,,
6084,ok . no deal,,,,,,,,,

10881,"that only leaves me 3 points . what about splitting the hats , you can have the book and i'll take the ball ?",,,,,,,,,
10882,that doesn't add up . the total points are 10 . if the 4 books are worth nothing then the book and ball together have to equal 10 .,,,,,,,,,

13589,i'd like 2 balls and the hat .,,,,,,,,,
13590,same for me . that would leave me with almost no points . guess no deal . we just need to talk until the no deal button lights up .,,,,,,,,,
13591,books are 1 point . balls and hats are 2 . i don't deal if i end up with less than 5 - 6 points .,,,,,,,,,
13592,"i'd like the balls , you can keep everything else .",,,,,,,,,
13593,that would take away all my points and books hold no value to me . i'll take 2 balls and the hat or 3 balls ; rest you can have .,,,,,,,,,
13594,or we can compromise ; books are 0 points to you as well ? that seems odd .,,,,,,,,,
13595,exactly . give me 2 balls and let's move on with our lives .,,,,,,,,,
13596,i will let you have all 4 balls and i will take the other 3 items,,,,,,,,,

13612,no deal . only 3 points for me .,,,,,,,,,

14028,"the balls are the only ones of value , the hats also are mininally valued . however , you originally asked to take the book - so i'm assuming the balls are not your only item of any value . i'm fine with splitting the points up if we're not going to agree .",,,,,,,,,

14092,"i'd really like to keep the book , you can have the hat and three of the four balls .",,,,,,,,,
14093,"the hat is useless to me , but the book is worth far more than the balls , i could use the balls , but they're not nearly as worthy as the book .",,,,,,,,,
14094,"yeah , the book is going to be a deal breaker here .",,,,,,,,,
14095,"problem is , the balls aren't even worth half what the book is .",,,,,,,,,
14096,i cannot concede the book . i apologize .,,,,,,,,,
14097,i'd like the hat and the book you can keep all 4 balls,,,,,,,,,
14098,the balls are of no worth to me ; any chance you can reconsider taking all 4 balls and leaving me the hat and the book ?,,,,,,,,,
14099,i can't part with the book and the balls hold no value to me .,,,,,,,,,
14100,"well i'm not going to settle for no points , so i can't budge . its your call if you want to take the balls in exchange for the hat and the book .",,,,,,,,,
14101,"problem is , the balls give me no value and losing the book would not be worth anything to me . we can wait this out to agree on no deal or you can concede and take the balls .",,,,,,,,,
14102,"i want the ball , a book and hat",,,,,,,,,
14103,ok deal,,,,,,,,,

21787,ok deal,,,,,,,,,
21788,give me ball and one book,,,,,,,,,
21789,i need ball and book at least or no deal,,,,,,,,,
21790,"there's 1 book , so that's highly impossible . however , i'd like to take the book and the hat , you keep all 4 balls ?",,,,,,,,,
21791,exactly . . . hence . . . i keep the book and the hat and you keep all 4 balls .,,,,,,,,,
21792,the balls have no value to me . i will not agree to a deal without the book . the rest is negotiable .,,,,,,,,,
21793,sounds fair . thank you .,,,,,,,,,
21794,hi what is we split the books ?,,,,,,,,,
21795,i can't use the hat,,,,,,,,,
21796,but i want the book !,,,,,,,,,
21797,ok i'll take the balls and you can have the book and hat,,,,,,,,,
21798,you're welcome,,,,,,,,,
21799,how about one book and one ball ?,,,,,,,,,
21800,does that work for you ?,,,,,,,,,
21801,if i can have the book and the balls you can have the hats,,,,,,,,,
21802,okay so i will take one book and one ball and you will take the rest ?,,,,,,,,,
21803,that is fine . thank you !,,,,,,,,,
21804,"how about you get all the hats , i get book and ball ?",,,,,,,,,
21805,best i can do ; i definitely can't part with the hat .,,,,,,,,,
21806,"i did . . . i meant the book , sorry !",,,,,,,,,
21807,i would like the hats and the book .,,,,,,,,,
21808,is that your absolute best offer ?,,,,,,,,,
21809,i thought you wanted the book and ball ?,,,,,,,,,
21810,okay ! i'll take all four hats . you take the rest .,,,,,,,,,
21811,hello,,,,,,,,,
21812,actually i would like the two balls as nothing else is of value to me .,,,,,,,,,
21813,well what are the books valued for you ?,,,,,,,,,
21814,they are valued at 0 for me so both of the books would net you 4 the hat is of no value to me . i would like both balls as it would also net me 4 points .,,,,,,,,,
21815,balls are not 5 each for me i have not value for the hat also does not indicate no value just no value to me .,,,,,,,,,
21816,so what is you proposed offer ?,,,,,,,,,
21817,well i propose you take both books and i take the hat and the balls .,,,,,,,,,
21818,"hello , i'd like the two balls ; we can negotiate on everything else . what's of value t o you ?",,,,,,,,,
21819,that won't work for me ; i assume we have a similar point distributions . we can split it down the middle and rock paper scissors for the 0 value hat ?,,,,,,,,,
21820,2,,,,,,,,,
21821,"that makes 0 sense ; if everything else was 0 for you - balls would be 5 each to you . so instead of dishonesty , let's split it down the middle .",,,,,,,,,
21822,"again ; basic math with 10 points distributed would state that your "" 2 balls would net you 4 points"" as a dishonest statement . i assume your balls are 4 each ; hat being 2 . we can do this dance or i take 5 points , you take 6 and we move on after wasting way",,,,,,,,,
21823,"to be as fair as possible ; your ball and hat would net you 6 . . . a ball and a book would net me 5 ; but since books are 0 to you , might as well let me take both . i propose i take 2 books and a ball , you take ball and a hat . if you want to make me suffer ; i'",,,,,,,,,

24826,i can part ways with the balls if you let me keep the book .,,,,,,,,,

24828,well then,,,,,,,,,
24829,i would like both books and both hats .,,,,,,,,,
24830,"so i'll take both hats and the ball , then ?",,,,,,,,,
24831,i'd be much happier with just one hat (i've only got one head) and the ball .,,,,,,,,,
24832,"one ball , one book , both hats .",,,,,,,,,
24833,"2 : 3 is fair , as in one ball and one hat for me , one hat and two books for you .",,,,,,,,,
24834,not a chance . lol . come up with something better than that .,,,,,,,,,
24835,"i'll take just the ball , methinks . that's nice , right ?",,,,,,,,,
24836,"i don't like wearing hats , so you can have both of those . i will also give you one of the hats",,,,,,,,,
24837,"nope , i meant book earlier . so you can have both hats and a book and i'll just take only the ball and a book",,,,,,,,,
24838,your original deal didn't include the ball so that is off the table . but i will give you one of the books with the two hats (in case you lose your first one ! ),,,,,,,,,
24839,4 : 1 is not fair . you can have both hats and one book .,,,,,,,,,
24840,"no i can't give up the ball , and you didn't even want the ball to begin with . i guess i will have to be the one to sacrifice and agree to your original deal - one ball for me and the rest for you .",,,,,,,,,
24841,"it was your original deal - i am just repeating what you said . the only other offer we haven't considered if giving me the ball and two books and you can just have the two hats , which is now my new deal since you backed away from your original offer .",,,,,,,,,
24842,"sorry buddy , there will be no deal today .",,,,,,,,,
24843,"how about i take the 3 hats and one 2 books , you can have the ball and one book",,,,,,,,,
24844,"ok , take 2 books , i`ll have 3 hats and the ball",,,,,,,,,

24849,thanks,,,,,,,,,
24850,"you're going to hate me , but what are your thoughts on you getting the two balls and me keeping the rest ?",,,,,,,,,
24851,"well , that's not very nice . . . i assume we have a similar distribution ; let's to go even with splitting everything down the middle ?",,,,,,,,,
24852,"i'll settle on that . . . you get hats and basketball , i get books and 1 basketball .",,,,,,,,,
24853,that im gonna hate you . how about you keep the balls i take the rest ?,,,,,,,,,

24889,"there's 4 . hats have no value to me . without the book , there's no way i can make a deal .",,,,,,,,,
24890,"you just stated hats have ""very little"" value , which means that they have value . again , we can go back and forth or we can come to a compromise of sorts .",,,,,,,,,

25104,ok you get the book and 2 balls deal ?,,,,,,,,,
25105,"no , i will need either the book or the hat .",,,,,,,,,
25106,if i cannot have the book i will need the hat and at least three balls .,,,,,,,,,
25107,can i have a second ball ? then we have a deal .,,,,,,,,,
25108,"ok , i agree .",,,,,,,,,
25109,"you can have the hat and 1 ball , and ill take the rest",,,,,,,,,
25110,hey there ! i'd like the hat and maybe 2 balls ? what about you ?,,,,,,,,,
25111,deal,,,,,,,,,
25112,i'd like the balls .,,,,,,,,,
25113,you can have the hats too . they're 0 for me .,,,,,,,,,
25114,cool . i want the book .,,,,,,,,,
25115,"okay , deal",,,,,,,,,
25116,can i get the book and balls,,,,,,,,,
25117,i cant give the book up,,,,,,,,,
25118,i need one other item with the book,,,,,,,,,
25119,ok deal,,,,,,,,,
25120,i need a book and 2 balls,,,,,,,,,
25121,can i get the balls and 1 hat ?,,,,,,,,,
25122,sorry . i can't do that . i need 3 balls and 1 hat,,,,,,,,,
25123,everything is worth 2 points to me so figure out how i can walk away with atleast 6 and i'll agree to whatever you want .,,,,,,,,,
25124,that only gets me to 4 =\,,,,,,,,,
25125,"that's great ! how about we go the fair route though . i'll take 2 balls and a hat , you take 2 books and a ball ?",,,,,,,,,
25126,"i believe our concept of fairness is quite different . on that note , i'll take all 3 balls , you take the rest .",,,,,,,,,
25127,then i suppose no agreement will be reached .,,,,,,,,,
25128,books are of no value to me . i'd like the three balls ; or 2 balls and 1 hat .,,,,,,,,,
25129,that was not one of the options i was willing to settle for .,,,,,,,,,
25130,did you just repeat the same offer ? - - i'll take three balls or 2 balls and the hat .,,,,,,,,,
25131,"not possible , unfortunately . that'll put me below half . we can agree to disagree or we can meet in the middle .",,,,,,,,,
25132,alright,,,,,,,,,
25133,i want everything,,,,,,,,,
25134,how about you take the hat and i take everything else because that would be truly fair,,,,,,,,,
25135,"no , the only way we can reach an agreement is if you take the hat",,,,,,,,,
25136,you can have one boko and the hat,,,,,,,,,
25137,you can have one ball and the hat,,,,,,,,,
25138,will you settle for one hat and one ball ?,,,,,,,,,
25139,there is no way one hat and one ball will work for you ?,,,,,,,,,
25140,i was really trying to make a good deal and avoid not making a deal . lets go with you taking two balls and the hat,,,,,,,,,
25141,i would like the ball and two hats if possible,,,,,,,,,
25142,whats it worth to you,,,,,,,,,
25143,well i can imagine what it is worth to me so here we are . i would like the ball as wells o what else can we agree on ?,,,,,,,,,
25144,straight up how many points is that ball worth to you and i'll say yes or no to that deal .,,,,,,,,,
25145,"need to work on that hustle , its only worth 5 to me and all the stuff together is only worth 5 to me as well , your call .",,,,,,,,,
25146,take your ball and go play somewhere else then .,,,,,,,,,
25147,i have to have the ball,,,,,,,,,
25148,anything and you can imagine : ),,,,,,,,,
25149,i'll let you have everything if i can have the ball,,,,,,,,,
25150,8 and i have been getting too many warnings about doing so bad,,,,,,,,,
25151,"i need the ball and you can have the rest , hats are 0 for me and books are 1",,,,,,,,,

25153,"i can't do that , you take the books i get the hat and the ball",,,,,,,,,
25154,"same here , no deal",,,,,,,,,

25157,we can't tell each other taht,,,,,,,,,
25158,great,,,,,,,,,
25159,"hi , i want the hat and one book",,,,,,,,,
25160,i really need the hat . without the hat i`m at 3 points .,,,,,,,,,
25161,one hat and one book . thats all i need .,,,,,,,,,
25162,this is fair on my side . i won`t get many points . 3 for each,,,,,,,,,
25163,how much is it worth that hat for you ? and the ball ?,,,,,,,,,
25164,i`ll give you the hat and the ball . lets just move on,,,,,,,,,
25165,i'm a cowboy who's learning to read . i'd like the hat so i can keep the sun out of my eyes while i try to read .,,,,,,,,,
25166,can i have the book and ball,,,,,,,,,

25170,i need 2 hats then if i can't have the book .,,,,,,,,,
25171,i need the ball more than anything . how about i just get the ball and 1 hat ?,,,,,,,,,
25172,if i give up the ball i need everything else to make it worth it .,,,,,,,,,
25173,the ball isn't enough on it's own though for me . how about i just take the book and 3 hats ?,,,,,,,,,
25174,"cool , it's a deal",,,,,,,,,
25175,i want one of each - you can have three hats .,,,,,,,,,
25176,"no , but you can have the ball if i can get all the rest of it .",,,,,,,,,
25177,that doesn't work for me . you can have the book and two hats if i get the ball and the other two hats .,,,,,,,,,
25178,the ball is my best one too . so i really need all the rest of it to make it work okay for me .,,,,,,,,,
25179,"you can have the ball , i just need everything else .",,,,,,,,,
25180,i think we're in the same spot . . . so i'll agree to that .,,,,,,,,,
25181,can i get the balls and 2 books ?,,,,,,,,,
25182,"you can have the balls , the others are worth 2 each to me .",,,,,,,,,
